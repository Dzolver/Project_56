# Project_56
Project 56 is an initiative that all the involved members are currently aware of.
As for protocol, please refer the following points beforehand : 

1) Before pulling, make sure it is the latest version and that there are no modules that will clash with your work.
2) Before pushing, please state the areas/file structures you edited or created in a report document for the day and submit it to the team lead for clarification before pushing. This point is very important in order to avoid work clashes with the members.
3) Any miscellaneous files that are either of sample or experimental type that MUST be pushed as well, must always have a separate folder. DO NOT MIX ANY SAMPLE OR EXPERIMENTAL FILES INTO THE CURRENT FILE STRUCTURE.
4) After completing your task, please confirm the number of hours and any other comments on HackNPlan. Additionally, please stay on standby until you are given the green light to work on another task by the team lead.
5) Any features or logic that you feel, require a bit of explaining, must have its own document that is able to brief other members that may need help when attempting to contribute.
6) DO NOT PUSH the project to GitHub with it containing PRIVATE CODES or any other CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
7) If there are any special exclusions you would require from your work schedule, please contact the team lead and then notify the rest of the team to avoid misunderstandings.
8) Always make sure to double check your suggestions by asking the team lead or the client.
